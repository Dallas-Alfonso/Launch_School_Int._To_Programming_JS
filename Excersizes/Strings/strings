let string = 'launch school tech & talk';
let words = string.split(" ");
let newWords = [];                          Need this empty array to hold new values!


for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i += 1) {
  let word = words[i];                        // we need to work with INDIVIDUAL words here.  so we save mentioned word into a variable....
                                                We can handle this bettwe when we deal with individual words... decide what to do.... then push it to new array to be worked on

  newWords.push(word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1)); //turn to uppercase index 0 (first word) and combine it woth word again, buy with a letter taken of ( the 1st, to replace for Cap one)
  
}
  newWords.join(' ');
